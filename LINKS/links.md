## Week 01
[1. Introduction to Operating System](https://youtu.be/vBURTt97EkA)

A video from neso academy on youtube. Through this video, i became more aware of what an operating system is. This video also gave types of OS, the functions of OS, and goals of OS. I like how the creator explained it.

[2. Regular Expression Basics](https://youtu.be/KJG1dETacLI)

Video from Jason Wertz on Youtube about Regular expression's basics and examples. I like the video because the tutorial were clear and concise so it is easy to understand.
